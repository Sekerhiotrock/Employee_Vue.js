    The Management, or the Whitespring Management, is a mysterious faction in Appalachia around 2104. Their only known representative is Orlando, who supports the reborn Responders. The Management is intensely private, value the work of the Responders, and are stated to be the "owners" of the Whitespring.[1]

The Management relies on human agents like Orlando to act as its eyes, ears, and hands where necessary to maintain its interests, as it cannot travel.[2][3] At the same time, the Management has access to immense resources, allowing it to funnel food, medicine, and high-tech ultracells to the Responders. The only explanation given is that the Management "wisely invested its wealth, when such things mattered."[4] This apparently involved investing in the ATLAS Observatory, judging by the use of ultracells.[5]

The Management is stated to be headed by a "Mr. Otis," the Chairman at the head of the organization.[6] Any similarities to MODUS are vehemently denied by Orlando, who claims never to have heard about it.[7]
